## What is this thing?

**Boardgameinator** is a high-level comparison tool for boardgames. It allows users to iteratively build a long list of games by title and upvote their attributes, while always providing the guidance of game descriptions and short user review comments just a "double-click" away.

## Who is this thing for?

This tool if for anyone who is generally familiar with modern boardgaming, but who is not quite familiar with all of the game titles. These people need help determining what to play or what to buy. 

Selecting a boardgame for a gaming event is a multi-dimensional, ever-changing process; preferences for player count, complexity, theme, and game mechanics change from day to day and group to group.

## Why is this thing so awesome?

This tool surfaces, in a visually side-by-side fashion, the more qualitative pieces from the firehose of boardgame data at the much-loved [BoardGameGeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com) website. It de-nerdifies BGG. It gives you comparision that you can hopefully use, but is not so encyclopedic while doing so. You don't have to be a BGG user or have your collection saved online in order to use this tool. 

This tool is also opinionated, in the (unpopular) direction of shorter games that support more players. It doesn't let you geek out on every possible sort order. Because in the end, what makes boardgames so great and why they can affect different people so differently is that they are too complex to be so simply ranked by one metric, like BGG and many BGG tools tend to do.

## How does this thing work?

This app overlays user likes on top of boardgame metadata ingested from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to produce a ranked list of boardgames.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
