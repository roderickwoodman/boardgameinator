## What is this thing?

**Boardgameinator** is a high-level comparison tool for boardgames. It provides a playground where users can iteratively build a list of games, upvote those games' attributes, and get simple guidance (like game descriptions and short review comments) along the way.

Selecting a boardgame for any size of gaming event is a multi-dimensional, ever-changing process. Preferences for things like player count, complexity, and theme always change from day to day and from one gaming group to another.

## Who is this thing for?

In recent years, there has been such an explosion in the "designer" boardgame industry that that it can now be a little intimidating to confidently select a game to play or to buy without having the first-hand experience of playing it before. This tool attempts to help those users who are unfamiliar with the game titles they are considering to make that first-pass cut they need so that they can dig deeper on a select few. 

Secondarily, because this tool generates some statistics on the games that it is given, it can also be informative to gamers with big collections who want to achieve some kind of balance in the different types of games that they own.


## Why is this thing so awesome?

This tool recognizes that a boardgame is a quite complex and subjective beast to analyze, and it also recognizes that documenting this complexity in a deep, encyclopedia-style format (like most review resources including BoardGameGeek.com do), is not useful for comparison shoppers. Heck, modern e-commerce sites don't give you pages and pages of product descriptions for you to research your decision on your own, instead they give you clickable checkboxes across several factors that let you filter down closer to what you might actually want to buy. And this is the approach taken by **Boardgameinator**.

Here, the more qualitative, high-level game facets are surfaced in a visually side-by-side fashion. No community ranking information. No keeping separate browser tabs open showing everything for each game. And you don't have to be a BGG user or have your collection saved online in order to use this tool. It de-nerdifies the content from BoardGameGeek.com. 

Note that this tool won't let you geek out on every possible sort of the game list. It has a simpler interface because it favors shorter games as well as those games that support more players.

## How does this thing work?

This app overlays its user's likes on top of boardgame metadata ingested from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to produce a list of boardgames sorted by the user's preferences of the moment.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
