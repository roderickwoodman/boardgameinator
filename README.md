## What is this thing?

**Boardgameinator** is a tool that allows a user to compare multiple boardgames and rank their attributes according preference.

## Who is this thing for?

There has been an explosion of the designer boardgame industry in recent years. This tool is for the gamer who is aware of the huge number of boargame titles that are now on the market (or in their closet!), and needs help figuring out what to buy or play next.

## Why is this thing so awesome?

This tool pieces apart the firehose of boardgame data at the much-loved [BoardGameGeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com) website, cuts through their crude rankings and cult-of-the-new hotness, and prioritizes a list of boardgame titles according to the user's preferences. This provides a high-level comparison across games that is difficult to get from the encyclopedia-style game review and reference websites. 

This tool is opinionated, in the (unpopular) direction of shorter games that support more players. It doesn't let you geek out on every possible sort order. If you are thinking of playing or buying a long or a hyped game, then you already have many boardgame geeks on the Internet supporting you. So just do it. You don't need this tool. :-)

## How does this thing work?

This app overlays user likes on top of boardgame metadata ingested from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to produce a ranked list of boardgames.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
