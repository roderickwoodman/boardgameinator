## What is this thing?

Behold! My latest invention... the **BOARDGAMEINATOR**! It allows users to cut through the hype and eliminate boardgame titles of no value. Okay, that's enough of my [Dr. Doofenshmirtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj7yxI-r_ag) accent.

## How does it work?

This tool provides a playground where users can iteratively build a list of games (to play or buy), upvote those games' attributes, and get simple guidance (like game descriptions and short review comments) along the way. 

## Who is this thing for?

First of all, this IS NOT for geeks to manage their huge collections.

But it IS for anyone who is stalled in selecting a game from a pile of games because he or she is unfamiliar with a few of them.

## Why is this thing so awesome?

For good reason, the boardgameiverse starts and ends with [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com). It has everything. But that website and their tools have an immensely deep, encyclopedia-style bias.

This tool, however, treats converging on a boardgame to play or buy as if it were an e-commerce shopping experience. It presents games in a visually side-by-side fashion and hands users the ability to personalize the results. No BGG userid is needed.

## How does this thing work?

This app overlays its user's likes on top of boardgame metadata ingested from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to produce a list of boardgames sorted by the user's preferences of the moment.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
