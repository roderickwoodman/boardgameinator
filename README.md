## What is this thing?

**Boardgameinator** is a high-level comparison tool for boardgames. It allows users to iteratively build a game list of any length and upvote those games' attributes, while always keeping simple guidance (like game descriptions and short review comments) at the ready.

## Who is this thing for?

There has been such an explosion of "designer" boardgames that have been published within the last few years that it can now be a little intimidating to confidently select a game to play or buy without the first-hand experience of having played it before. This tool attempts to help the person who knows a few things that they like in other boardgames, but not much about the specific titles that they are considering. 

Selecting a boardgame for a gaming event is a multi-dimensional, ever-changing process. Preferences for things like player count, complexity, and theme change from day to day and from one gaming group to another.

## Why is this thing so awesome?

This tool recognizes that a boardgame is quite a complex and subjective beast to analyze, and it also recognizes that documenting this complexity in a deep, encyclopedia-style format (like most review resources including BoardGameGeek.com do), is not useful for comparison shoppers. Heck, modern e-commerce sites don't give you pages and pages of product descriptions for you to research your decision your own, instead they give you clickable checkboxes across several factors that let you filter down closer to what you might actually want to buy. And this is the approach of *Boardgameinator*.

Here, the more qualitative, high-level game facets are surfaced in a visually side-by-side fashion. No ranking information. No keeping separate browser tabs open for each game. And you don't have to be a BGG user or have your collection saved online in order to use this tool. It tries to de-nerdify the content from BoardGameGeek.com. 

Note that this tool won't let you geek out on every possible sort of the game list. It has a simpler interface because it favors shorter games as well as those that support more players.

## How does this thing work?

This app overlays user likes on top of boardgame metadata ingested from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to produce a ranked list of boardgames.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
