## What is this thing?

Behold! My latest invention... the **BOARDGAMEINATOR**! It allows users to cut through the hype and eliminate boardgame titles of no value. Okay, that's enough of my [Dr. Doofenshmirtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj7yxI-r_ag) accent.

This app is a sandbox for users to build and prioritize a list of boardgames that they are considering playing or purchasing. It supports an iterative process of adding and removing games, collecting summary information, and upvoting game features.

## Who is it for?

First of all, Boardgameinator IS NOT for geeks to manage their huge collections.

Instead, this app IS for anyone who has stalled out in selecting a game from a pile of games because he or she is unfamiliar with a few of them.

## Why is it so awesome?

The website [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com) (BGG) already has everything that you would want to know about boardgames. It is organized like an encyclopedia. This is great so long as you know what you are looking for and you can visit one game at a time.

Boardgameinator, however, treats converging on a boardgame to play or buy as if it were an e-commerce shopping experience. It presents all of the games at the same time in a visually side-by-side fashion and it hands users the ability to personalize the results. No BGG userid is needed.

## How does Boardgameinator work?

It overlays its user's likes on top of boardgame metadata ingested from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to produce a sorted list of boardgames.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
