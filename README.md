## What is this thing?

Behold, the **BOARDGAMEINATOR**!  (...said in my best [Dr. Doofenshmirtz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj7yxI-r_ag) accent)

This app is a sandbox for users to prioritize a list of boardgames that they are considering playing or purchasing. Once a game has been added, a small amount of its summary information is presented and its features can then be upvoted.

## Who is it for?

First of all, **Boardgameinator** IS NOT for geeks to manage their huge collections.

Instead, this app IS for anyone who feels overwhelmed or who has stalled out in selecting a boardgame. And with all of the new titles and all of the hype these days, I feel your pain.

## Why is it so awesome?

If you have ever looked for information about a boardgame, you probably found yourself on the [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com) (BGG) website. It is a great resource, but it is a firehose. Often there is actually too much information there, and the way it is organized it forces you to focus on one game at a time.

**Boardgameinator**, however, is a comparison tool that sits on top of all of that BGG data. It feels more like an e-commerce shopping experience. It presents all of the games at the same time in a visually side-by-side fashion with only a little bit of high-level information. From there, users can filter the results to meet their own preferences.

## How does Boardgameinator work?

The app looks up titles and pulls game information from [the BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2). It persists the user's game list and likes in their browser's local storage area. And finally, the various input controls on the page produce the final ordered and filtered list of games that the user sees.

## How do I run it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

As with other Create React App projects, from the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
